## User Experience (UX)

### General
In today's world of social media, professionally edited visuals are essential to preserving and sharing memorable experiences. Beeing About caters to this need by offering professional video and photography services tailored to travel adventures.

### Typography
The logo font inspired the website’s typography. **Hopper Script** is used sparingly on the homepage for decorative purposes, while the primary font is **Montserrat** for better readability. Feedback from early testers prompted changes to improve legibility, ensuring accessibility.
