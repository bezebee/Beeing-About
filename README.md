# ABOUT
##### Beeing About is a company that offers media services to those who love to travel, especially to Ireland. There are four services Beeing About is undertaking mainly, these are: 
- Filming
- Photography
- Itinerary Design
- Video Editing
 
# UX
### General
In the era of ever present social media, visuals have become stellar when it comes to saving memories of any experiences. It is no longer enough to have just couple of selfies, professionally edited videos and photos of holiday adventures are important addition to every travel diary. Ability to share professionally edited videos and photos is what attracts the potential clients of Beeing About.
### Typography
As the company was in existence before the website was designed, the logo already exists, so I decided to draw inspiration from the logo font and use it as an addition to the primary Montserrati. The decorative font is Hopper Script and it is used sparsely on the homepage. Initially it was used for on Gallery and Services pages too, but when the code was being reviewed on Slack, one of students (potential user) pointed out that it appears illegible. I decided to go with their suggestion and change most font back to Monserrati.
### Colors
Initially I was going to use the image as the background for container, but I changed this plan to use only existing travel videos filmed and edited by Beeing About team. This website is serving as their portfolio. I decided to keep the color scheme extremely minimalistic, in white and black, with some addition of green and gray. Green to represent Ireland, where Beeing About is mainly providing their services. 
### User Stories
- As a user I expect the site to be clean and transparent.
- As a user I want to be sure what page I am currently on
- As a user I want to know what the page is all about immediately after landing on it.
- As a user I want to be able to play and pause video without leaving the page
- As a user I do not want to read too much, short and concise information that gives full idea of the product on offer suffices
- As a user I want to be able to reach the Contact Page from each page
- As a user I want this page to work on every of my screens, be it mobile device or my huge 4K television screen
- As a user I would generally watch video in horizontal mode, so I want to be able to choose full screen and rotate my phone

# FEATURES
Beeing About site is a four page website following the usual concept.
### Home
Landing page which introduces prospect clients to the company with a short intro explaining their ethos. As they scroll down, visitors can watch the video, which is designed to showcase the skills as well as invite them to the adventure. The opening quote by Seth Godin is meant to inspire those over-worked souls dreaming of something different.
Further on the landing page there are three testimonials, which mention samples of the service, this may lift some of the ambiguity and invite further exploration of services offered.
### Gallery 
Video is a more unique service to photography, can be more attractive and is definitely more expensive, so here I felt it is of most importance to showcase previous works. Each video is about a different place, it can serve as additional inspiration where visitors may decide they want to go. To take advantage of any sale opportunity, there is a CTA button in a form of “Order your Travel Plan today” call. This opens in a separate tab and lets the prospect client send their request, order or simply just enquire.
### Services
There are four main services offered, which can be mixed and matched. Prices are set, but the client is invited to ask about bundle offers. The accordion feature on this page is an interesting method of displaying the current offer, whilst enabling addition of other services, later on.
### Contact
This part offers both, contacting the company directly via form, or just utilising provided details to either phone them or send a direct email. There is also a postal address available.

# TESTING
The website is bright and transparent, easy to navigate.
Each page has a heading to affirm the user which page they are currently on.
- The Home page welcomes me with the outline of Beeing About service and an immediate Call To Action button which brings me to the Contact page. The video offers additional visuals as it is one of company's creation, as a prospect client I am imagining this could be me in that video, the uplifting message in the video further invites exploring of the offer. When I scroll further, some clients stories offer examples of services offered and clients feedback. 
- The Gallery page offers the portfolio of their works, which essentially shows me the quality of it. Again, as a prospect client, I am attracted to the idea of having one of these videos done for me. If I was not sure which part of Ireland to visit, the destinations in each video may inspire me. The Call To Action button under each video enables me to click on it and order a plan or more.
- On each of the pages there is a button that calls for interaction, Home page has Request a Call Back,Gallery has Order your Travel Plan, Services has Register your Interest button. These three buttons lead to the Contact page, which offers both Contact form, as well as the direct contact details, such as phone number and email, in case the prospect client would like to phone the company directly.
- All except for Message fields in the Contact form are required. There are radio selectors, which offer more detailed information on what the prospect client is interested in. Although Message input is optional, it offers a further chance for the prospect to explain what attracts them in the company's offer.
### Browsers testing
#### Chrome 
All good. While building the site I have extensively utilised Chrome in the Developer mode, I found it extremely useful, especially that some modifications could be seen immediately after new values were applied. 
#### Mozilla Firefox 
All as expected, except for the number field in the contact form. Arrows are showing for the numbers.
#### Safari 
Responsive and displaying the website in order
### Mobile testing
Main tests conducted while the website was being designed were based on the Developer Mode, as main design rests on Bootstrap system, both vertical and horizontal set up are perfect. I also had an iPhone 7, Samsung S7 and Samsung S8 standing by to check out the actual performance and all returned perfect outcomes.T

### Acknowledgements
I really liked the idea of including an Iframe of a Google map in the Contact page, so I looked for inspiration on how this could be achieved in Bootstrap. In the process of research on how to put the Contact page together I came across this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9dL516qYL4w, in which Dinesh Varyani explains the basics of using Bootstrap to code a responsive Contact form. I followed it and used some of his code as an inspiration to my own Contact page.

Also, throughout the project I have been relying on Bootstrap ability to keep the pages responsive, I found it very useful and timesaving. I really wanted to use videos as the portfolio as it was fitting to the offer advertised by Beeing About, so needed to look into how to make them responsive on all screen sizes. Chapter [Embed](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/utilities/embed) on Bootstrap was an absolute life saver for achieving this.
